    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture extends and modifies the model in this lecture [A Monetarist Theory of Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html) by modifying the\n",
    "law of motion that governed the supply of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model in this lecture consists of two components\n",
    "\n",
    "- a demand function for money  \n",
    "- a law of motion for the supply of money  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand function describes the public’s demand for “real balances”, defined as the ratio of nominal money balances to the price level\n",
    "\n",
    "- it assumes that the demand for real balance today varies inversely with the rate of inflation that the public forecasts to prevail between today and tomorrow  \n",
    "- it assumes that the public’s forecast of that rate of inflation is perfect  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The law of motion for the supply of money assumes that the government prints money to finance government expenditures\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model equates the demand for money to the supply at each time $ t \\geq 0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equality between those demands and supply gives a *dynamic* model in which   money supply\n",
    "and  price level *sequences* are simultaneously determined by a  set of simultaneous linear  equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations take the form of what is often called vector linear **difference equations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we’ll roll up our sleeves and solve those equations in two different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "(One of the methods for solving vector linear  difference equations will take advantage of a decomposition of a matrix that is studied in this lecture [Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors](https://intro.quantecon.org/eigen_I.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will encounter these concepts from macroeconomics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an **inflation tax** that a government gathers by printing paper or electronic money  \n",
    "- a dynamic **Laffer curve** in the inflation tax rate that has two stationary equilibria  \n",
    "- perverse dynamics under rational expectations in which the system converges to the higher stationary inflation tax rate  \n",
    "- a peculiar comparative stationary-state outcome connected with that stationary inflation rate: it asserts that inflation can be *reduced* by running *higher*  government deficits, i.e., by raising more resources by printing money.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The same qualitative outcomes prevail in this lecture [Inflation Rate Laffer Curves](https://intro.quantecon.org/money_inflation_nonlinear.html) that studies a nonlinear version of the model in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "These outcomes  set the stage for the analysis to be presented in this lecture [Laffer Curves  with Adaptive Expectations](https://intro.quantecon.org/laffer_adaptive.html) that studies a nonlinear version of the present model; it   assumes a version of “adaptive expectations” instead of rational expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "That lecture will show that\n",
    "\n",
    "- replacing rational expectations with adaptive expectations leaves the two stationary inflation rates unchanged, but that $ \\ldots $  \n",
    "- it reverses the perverse dynamics by making the *lower* stationary inflation rate the one to which the system typically converges  \n",
    "- a more plausible comparative dynamic outcome emerges in which now inflation can be *reduced* by running *lower*  government deficits  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This outcome will be used to justify a selection of a stationary inflation rate that underlies the analysis of unpleasant monetarist arithmetic to be studied in this lecture [Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic](https://intro.quantecon.org/unpleasant.html).\n",
