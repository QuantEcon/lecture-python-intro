    "This lecture series introduces quantitative economics using elementary\n",
    "mathematics and statistics plus computer code written in\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lectures emphasize simulation and visualization through code as a way to\n",
    "convey ideas, rather than focusing on mathematical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the presentation is quite novel, the ideas are rather foundational.\n",
    "\n",
    "We emphasize the deep and fundamental importance of economic theory, as well\n",
    "as the value of analyzing data and understanding stylized facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lectures can be used for university courses, self-study, reading groups or\n",
    "workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers and policy professionals might also find some parts of the series\n",
    "valuable for their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope the lectures will be of interest to students of economics\n",
    "who want to learn both economics and computing, as well as students from\n",
    "fields such as computer science and engineering who are curious about\n",
    "economics."

    "year undergraduates or even high school students) to more intermediate.\n",

    "The\n",
