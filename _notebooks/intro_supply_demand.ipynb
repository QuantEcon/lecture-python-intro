    "In the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, mercantilist ideas held sway among most rulers of European countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exports were regarded as good because they brought in bullion (gold flowed into the country).\n",

    "Imports were regarded as bad because bullion was required to pay for them (gold flowed out).\n",

    "This [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) view of economics was eventually overturned by the work of the classical economists such as [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith) and [David Ricado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo), who showed how freeing domestic and international trade can enhance welfare.\n",

    "There are many different expressions of this idea in economics.\n",

    "This lecture discusses one of the simplest: how free adjustment of prices can maximize a measure of social welfare in the market for a single good."
