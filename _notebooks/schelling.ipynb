    "\n",
    "In 1969, Thomas C. Schelling developed a simple but striking model of racial\n",
    "segregation [[Sch69](zreferences.ipynb#id217)].\n",
    "\n",
    "His model studies the dynamics of racially mixed neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like much of Schelling’s work, the model shows how local interactions can lead\n",
    "to surprising aggregate outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It studies a setting where agents (think of households) have relatively mild\n",
    "preference for neighbors of the same race.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, these agents might be comfortable with a mixed race neighborhood\n",
    "but uncomfortable when they feel “surrounded” by people from a different race.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schelling illustrated the follow surprising result: in such a setting, mixed\n",
    "race neighborhoods are likely to be unstable, tending to collapse over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact the model predicts strongly divided neighborhoods, with high levels of\n",
    "segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, extreme segregation outcomes arise even though people’s\n",
    "preferences are not particularly extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "These extreme outcomes happen because of *interactions* between agents in the\n",
    "model (e.g., households in a city) that drive self-reinforcing dynamics in the\n",
    "model.\n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas will become clearer as the lecture unfolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recognition of his work on segregation and other research, Schelling was\n",
