    "\n",
    "We use the log-linear version of the demand function for money that  [[Cagan, 1956](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id112)]\n",
    "used in his classic paper in place of the linear demand function used in [Money Financed Government Deficits and Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/money_inflation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "That change requires that we modify parts of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, our dynamic system is no longer linear in state variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the economic logic underlying an  analysis based on what we called ‘‘method 2’’  remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall discover qualitatively similar outcomes to those that we studied  in [Money Financed Government Deficits and Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/money_inflation.html).\n",

    "As in that  lecture,  we discussed these topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an **inflation tax** that a government gathers by printing paper or electronic money  \n",
    "- a dynamic **Laffer curve** in the inflation tax rate that has two stationary equilibria  \n",
    "- perverse dynamics under rational expectations in which the system converges to the higher stationary inflation tax rate  \n",
    "- a peculiar comparative stationary-state analysis connected with that stationary inflation rate that asserts that inflation can be *reduced* by running *higher*  government deficits  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These outcomes will set the stage for the analysis of [Laffer Curves  with Adaptive Expectations](https://intro.quantecon.org/laffer_adaptive.html) that studies a version of the present model that  uses a version of “adaptive expectations” instead of rational expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "That lecture will show that\n",
    "\n",
    "- replacing rational expectations with adaptive expectations leaves the two stationary inflation rates unchanged, but that $ \\ldots $  \n",
    "- it reverses the perverse dynamics by making the *lower* stationary inflation rate the one to which the system typically converges  \n",
