    "\n",
    "In this lecture we study  a situation  in which a stationary equilibrium prevails after  date $ T > 0 $, but not before then.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $ t=0, \\ldots, T-1 $, the money supply,  price level, and interest-bearing government debt vary along a transition path that ends at $ t=T $.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this transition, the ratio of the real balances $ \\frac{m_{t+1}}{{p_t}} $ to indexed one-period  government bonds $ \\tilde R B_{t-1} $  maturing at time $ t $ decreases each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has consequences for the **gross-of-interest** government deficit that must be financed by printing money for times $ t \\geq T $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical **money-to-bonds** ratio stabilizes only at time $ T $ and afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the larger is $ T $, the higher is the gross-of-interest government deficit that must be financed\n",
    "by printing money at times $ t \\geq T $.\n",
    "\n",
    "These outcomes are the essential finding of Sargent and Wallace’s “unpleasant monetarist arithmetic” [[Sargent and Wallace, 1981](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id293)].\n",

    "That lecture  described  supplies and demands for money that appear in lecture.\n",

    "It also   characterized the steady state equilibrium from which we work backwards in this lecture.\n",
