    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture describes some monetary and fiscal  features of the French Revolution (1789-1799)\n",
    "described by [[Sargent and Velde, 1995](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id290)].\n",
    "\n",
    "To finance public expenditures and service its debts,\n",
    "the French Revolutionaries  performed several policy experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Revolutionary legislators who authored these experiments were guided by their having decided to put in place monetary-fiscal policies recommended to them  by theories that they believed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of those theories make contact with modern theories about monetary and fiscal policies that interest us today.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a *tax-smoothing* model like Robert Barro’s [[Barro, 1979](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id166)]  \n",
    "  - this normative (i.e., prescriptive mode) advises a government to finance temporary war-time surges in government expenditures mostly by issuing government debt; after the war to roll over whatever debt accumulated during the war, and  to increase taxes permanently by enough to finance interest payments on that post-war debt  \n",
    "- *unpleasant monetarist arithmetic* like that described in [Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic](https://intro.quantecon.org/unpleasant.html)  \n",
    "  - this arithmetic governed French government debt dynamics in the decades preceding 1789 and according to leading historians set the stage for the French Revolution  \n",
    "- a **real bills** theory of the effects of government open market operations in which the government *backs* its issues of paper money with valuable real property or financial assets  \n",
    "  - the Revolutionaries learned about this theory from Adam Smith’s 1776 book The Wealth of Nations\n",
    "    and other contemporary sources  \n",
    "  - It shaped how the Revolutionaries issued paper money called assignats from 1789 to 1791  \n",
    "- a classical **gold**  or **silver standard**  \n",
    "  - Napoleon, who became head of government in 1799 used this theory to guide his monetary and fiscal policies  \n",
    "- a classical inflation-tax theory of inflation in which Philip Cagan’s  demand for money studied\n",
    "  in this lecture  [A Monetarist Theory of Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html) is a key component  \n",
    "  - This theory helps us explain French price level and money supply data from 1794 to 1797  s  \n",
    "- a *legal restrictions*  or *financial repression* theory of the demand for real balances  \n",
    "  - the Twelve Members comprising the Committee of Public Safety who adminstered the Terror from June 1793 to July 1794 used this theory to guide their monetary policy  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use matplotlib to replicate several of the graphs that [[Sargent and Velde, 1995](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id290)] used to portray outcomes of these experiments"
