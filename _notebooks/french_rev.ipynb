    "\n",
    "This lecture describes some  of the monetary and fiscal  features of the French Revolution (1789-1799) described by [[Sargent and Velde, 1995](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id292)].\n",
    "\n",
    "To finance public expenditures and service its debts,\n",
    "the French government embarked on   policy experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of these experiments  had in mind theories about how government  monetary and fiscal policies affected economic outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of those theories about monetary and fiscal policies still interest us today.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a **tax-smoothing** model like Robert Barro’s [[Barro, 1979](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id168)]  \n",
    "  - this normative (i.e., prescriptive model) advises a government to finance temporary war-time surges in expenditures mostly by issuing government debt, raising taxes by just enough to service the additional debt issued during the wary; then,   after the war,  to roll over whatever debt the government had accumulated during the war;  and  to increase taxes after the war permanently by just enough to finance interest payments on that post-war government  debt  \n",
    "- **unpleasant monetarist arithmetic** like that described in this quanteon lecture  [Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic](https://intro.quantecon.org/unpleasant.html)  \n",
    "  - mathematics involving compound interest  governed French government debt dynamics in the decades preceding 1789; according to leading historians, that arithmetic set the stage for the French Revolution  \n",
    "- a *real bills* theory of the effects of government open market operations in which the government *backs* new  issues of paper money with government holdings of valuable real property or financial assets that holders of money can purchase from the government in exchange for their money.  \n",
    "  - The Revolutionaries learned about this theory from Adam Smith’s 1776 book The Wealth of Nations\n",
    "    [[Smith, 2010](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id11)] and other contemporary sources  \n",
    "  - It shaped how the Revolutionaries issued a paper money called **assignats** from 1789 to 1791  \n",
    "- a classical **gold**  or **silver standard**  \n",
    "  - Napoleon Bonaparte became head of the French government in 1799. He  used this theory to guide his monetary and fiscal policies  \n",
    "- a classical **inflation-tax** theory of inflation in which Philip Cagan’s ([[Cagan, 1956](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id112)]) demand for money studied in this lecture  [A Monetarist Theory of Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html) is a key component  \n",
    "  - This theory helps  explain French price level and money supply data from 1794 to 1797  \n",
    "- a **legal restrictions**  or **financial repression** theory of the demand for real balances  \n",
    "  - The Twelve Members comprising the Committee of Public Safety who adminstered the Terror from June 1793 to July 1794 used this theory to shape their monetary policy  \n",
