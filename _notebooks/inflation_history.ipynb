    "\n",
    "Chapter 3 of [[Sargent and Velde, 2002](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id12)] offers an explanation for this remarkable pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, here is the explanation offered there.\n",
    "\n",
    "After World War I, the United States was on a gold standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US government stood ready to convert a dollar into a specified amount of gold on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after World War I, Hungary, Austria, Poland, and Germany were not on the gold standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their currencies were “fiat” or “unbacked”, meaning that they were not backed by credible government promises to convert them into gold or silver coins on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The governments printed new paper notes to pay for goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Technically the notes were “backed” mainly by treasury bills. But people could not expect that those treasury bills would be paid off by levying taxes, but instead by printing more notes or treasury bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done on such a scale that it led to a depreciation of the currencies of spectacular proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the German mark stabilized at 1 trillion ($ 10^{12} $) paper marks to the prewar gold mark, the Polish mark at 1.8 million paper marks to the gold zloty, the Austrian crown at 14,400 paper crowns to the prewar Austro-Hungarian crown, and the Hungarian krone at 14,500 paper crowns to the prewar Austro-Hungarian crown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3 of [[Sargent and Velde, 2002](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id12)]  described deliberate changes in policy that Hungary, Austria, Poland, and Germany made to end their hyperinflations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each government stopped printing money to pay for goods and services once again and made its currency convertible to the US dollar or the UK pound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story told in [[Sargent and Velde, 2002](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id12)] is grounded in a *monetarist theory of the price level* described in [A Monetarist Theory of Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html) and [Monetarist Theory of Price Levels with Adaptive Expectations](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_adaptive.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Those lectures discuss theories about what owners of those rapidly depreciating currencies were thinking and how their beliefs shaped responses of inflation to government monetary and fiscal policies."
