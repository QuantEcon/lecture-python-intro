    "A striking thing about our four graphs is how **quickly** the (log) price levels in Austria, Hungary, Poland,\n",
    "and Germany leveled off after having been rising so quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these big inflations seemed to have “stopped on a dime”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3 of [[SV02](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id4)] attempts to offer an explanation for this remarkable pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, here is his story.\n",
    "\n",
    "After World War I, the United States was on the gold standard. The US government stood ready to convert a dollar into a specified amount of gold on demand. To understate things, immediately after the war, Hungary, Austria, Poland, and Germany were not on the gold standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, their currencies were largely “fiat,” or unbacked. The governments of these countries resorted to the printing of new unbacked money to finance government deficits. (The notes were “backed” mainly by treasury bills that, in those times, could not be expected to be paid off by levying taxes, but only by printing more notes or treasury bills.) This was done on such a scale that it led to a depreciation of the currencies of spectacular proportions. In the end, the German mark stabilized at 1 trillion ($ 10^{12} $) paper marks to the prewar gold mark, the Polish mark at 1.8 million paper marks to the gold zloty, the Austrian crown at 14,400 paper crowns to the prewar Austro-Hungarian crown, and the Hungarian krone at 14,500 paper crowns to the prewar Austro-Hungarian crown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3 of [[SV02](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id4)]  focuses on the deliberate changes in policy that Hungary, Austria, Poland, and Germany made to end their hyperinflations.\n",
    "The hyperinflations were each ended by restoring or virtually restoring convertibility to the dollar or equivalently to gold."
