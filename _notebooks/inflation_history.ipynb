    "The rate of growth of the price level is called **inflation** in the popular press and in discussions among central bankers and treasury officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price level is measured in units of domestic currency per units of a representative bundle of consumption goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in the US, the price level at  $ t $  is measured in dollars in month $ t $ or year $ t $  per unit of the consumption bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until the early 20th century, throughout much of the west, although price levels fluctuated from year to  year, they didn’t have much of a trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "They tended to end a century near where  they started it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things were different in the 20th century, as we shall see in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll indicater a widely believed explanation of this big difference – countries’ abandoning gold and silver standards in early twentieth century.\n",

    "In addition, the US dollar exchange rates for each of the four countries shadowed their price levels.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Chapter 3 of [[SV02](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id7)] offers an explanation for this remarkable pattern.\n",

    "\n",
    "After World War I, the United States was on a gold standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US government stood ready to convert a dollar into a specified amount of gold on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after World War I, Hungary, Austria, Poland, and Germany were not on the gold standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their currencies were  “fiat” or “unbacked”,  meaning that they were not backed by credible government promises to convert them into gold or silver coins on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The governments  printed new paper notes to pay for goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Technically the notes were “backed” mainly by treasury bills. But people could not expect that those treasury bills would  be paid off by levying taxes, but instead by printing more notes or treasury bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done on such a scale that it led to a depreciation of the currencies of spectacular proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the German mark stabilized at 1 trillion ($ 10^{12} $) paper marks to the prewar gold mark, the Polish mark at 1.8 million paper marks to the gold zloty, the Austrian crown at 14,400 paper crowns to the prewar Austro-Hungarian crown, and the Hungarian krone at 14,500 paper crowns to the prewar Austro-Hungarian crown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3 of [[SV02](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id7)]  described  deliberate changes in policy that Hungary, Austria, Poland, and Germany made to end their hyperinflations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each governent  stoppped printing money to pay for goods and services once again made its currency  convertible  to the US dollar or the UK pound, thereby vitually  to gold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story told in [[SV02](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id7)] is grounded in a “monetarist theory of the price level” described in [this lecture](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html) and\n",
    "[this lecture](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_adaptive.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Those lectures discuss theories about what owners  of those rapidly depreciating currencies were thinking  and how their beliefs shaped responses of inflation to government monetary and fiscal  policies."
