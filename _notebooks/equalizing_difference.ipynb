    ">Milton Friedman used our   model  to study whether  differences in the earnings of US dentists and doctors were justified by competitive labor markets or whether\n",
    "they reflected entry barriers imposed by US governments working in conjunction with doctors’ lobbies.  Chapter 4 of Jennifer Burns [[Bur23](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id3)] presents an\n",
    "interesting account of Milton Friedman’s joint work with Simon Kuznets that eventually  led to the publication of [[KF39](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id4)] and [[FK45](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id5)]. To map  Friedman’s application to our model, think of our high school students as Friedman’s dentists and our college graduates as Friedman’s doctors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is “incomplete” in the sense that it is just one “condition” in the form of a single equation that would be part of set equations comprising all  “equilibrium conditions” of   a more fully articulated model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition featured in our model determines  a college, high-school wage ratio that equalizes the present values of a high school worker and a college educated worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this condition is that lifetime earnings have to adjust to make someone indifferent between going to college and not going to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The job of the “other equations” in a more complete model would be to fill in details about what adjusts to bring about this outcome.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just one instance of an  “equalizing difference” theory of relative wage rates, a class of theories dating back at least to Adam Smith’s **Wealth of Nations** [[Smi10](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id6)].\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of this lecture, the only mathematical tools that we’ll use are from linear algebra, in particular, matrix multiplication and matrix inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at the very end of the lecture, we’ll use calculus just in case readers want to see how computing partial derivatives could let us present some findings more concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "(And doing that will let us show off how good Python is at doing calculus!)\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you don’t know calculus, our tools from linear algebra are certainly enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we’ll start by importing some Python modules."
