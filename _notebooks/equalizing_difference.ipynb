    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture presents a model of the college-high-school wage gap in which the\n",
    "“time to build” a college graduate plays a key role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Milton Friedman invented the   model  to study whether  differences in  earnings of US dentists and doctors were outcomes of  competitive labor markets or whether\n",
    "they reflected entry barriers imposed by governments working in conjunction with doctors’ professional organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4 of Jennifer Burns [[Burns, 2023](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id4)] describes  Milton Friedman’s joint work with Simon Kuznets that eventually  led to the publication of [[Kuznets and Friedman, 1939](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id5)] and [[Friedman and Kuznets, 1945](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id6)].\n",
    "\n",
    "To map  Friedman’s application into our model, think of our high school students as Friedman’s dentists and our college graduates as Friedman’s doctors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our presentation is “incomplete” in the sense that it is based on  a single equation that would be part of set equilibrium conditions of a more fully articulated model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ‘‘equalizing difference’’ equation  determines  a college-high-school wage ratio that equalizes present values of a high school educated  worker and a college educated worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea  is that lifetime earnings somehow adjust to make a new high school worker indifferent between going to college and not going to college but instead going to work immmediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The job of the “other equations” in a more complete model would be to describe what adjusts to bring about this outcome.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is just one example  of an  “equalizing difference” theory of relative wage rates, a class of theories dating back at least to Adam Smith’s **Wealth of Nations** [[Smith, 2010](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id7)].\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of this lecture, the only mathematical tools that we’ll use are from linear algebra, in particular, matrix multiplication and matrix inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, near the  end of the lecture, we’ll use calculus just in case readers want to see how computing partial derivatives could let us present some findings more concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "And doing that will let illustrate how good Python is at doing calculus!\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you don’t know calculus, our tools from linear algebra are certainly enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we’ll start by importing some Python modules."
