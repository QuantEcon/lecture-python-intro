    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of the OLG model are quite similar to those of the Solow-Swan\n",
    "growth model.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the OLG model adds an important new feature: the choice of\n",
    "how much to save is endogenous.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this is important, suppose, for example, that we are interested in\n",
    "predicting the effect of a new tax on long-run growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could add a tax to the Solow-Swan model and look at the change in the\n",
    "steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this ignores the fact that households will change their savings and\n",
    "consumption behavior when they face the new tax rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such changes can substantially alter the predictions of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, if we care about accurate predictions, we should model the decision\n",
    "problems of the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, households in the model should decide how much to save and how\n",
    "much to consume, given the environment that they face (technology, taxes,\n",
    "prices, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLG model takes up this challenge.\n",
