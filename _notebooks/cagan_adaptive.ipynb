    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is a sequel or prequel to the lecture [A Monetarist Theory of  Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use linear algebra to do some experiments with  an alternative “monetarist” or  “fiscal” theory of  price levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the model in [A Monetarist Theory of  Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html), the model asserts that when a government persistently spends more than it collects in taxes and prints money to finance the shortfall, it puts upward pressure on the price level and generates persistent inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the “perfect foresight” or “rational expectations” version of the model in [A Monetarist Theory of  Price Levels](https://intro.quantecon.org/cagan_ree.html), our model in the present lecture is an “adaptive expectations”  version of a model that Philip Cagan [[Cag56](https://intro.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id107)]  used to study the monetary dynamics of hyperinflations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines these components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a demand function for real money balances that asserts that the logarithm of the quantity of real balances demanded depends inversely on the public’s expected rate of inflation  \n",
    "- an **adaptive expectations** model that describes how the public’s anticipated rate of inflation responds to past values of actual inflation  \n",
    "- an equilibrium condition that equates the demand for money to the supply  \n",
    "- an exogenous sequence of rates of growth of the money supply  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model stays quite close to Cagan’s original specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the lectures [Present Values](https://intro.quantecon.org/pv.html) and [Consumption Smoothing](https://intro.quantecon.org/cons_smooth.html), the only linear algebra operations that we’ll be  using are matrix multiplication and matrix inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate using  linear matrix algebra as our principal mathematical tool, we’ll use a finite horizon version of\n",
    "the model."
