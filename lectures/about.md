# About These Lectures


## About

This lecture series introduces quantitative economics using elementary
mathematics and statistics plus computer code written in
[Python](https://www.python.org/).  

The lectures emphasize simulation and visualization through code as a way to
convey ideas, rather than focusing on mathematical details.

Although the presentation is quite novel, the ideas are rather foundational.

We emphasize the deep and fundamental importance of economic theory, as well
as the value of analyzing data and understanding stylized facts.

The lectures can be used for university courses, self-study, reading groups or
workshops. 

Researchers and policy professionals might also find some parts of the series
valuable for their work.  

We hope the lectures will be of interest to students of economics
who want to learn both economics and computing, as well as students from
fields such as computer science and engineering who are curious about
economics.

## Level

The lecture series is aimed at undergraduate students. 

The level of the lectures varies from truly introductory (suitable for first
year undergraduates or even high school students) to more intermediate.

The
more intermediate lectures require comfort with linear algebra and some
mathematical maturity (e.g., calmly reading theorems and trying to understand
their meaning).  

In general, easier lectures occur earlier in the lecture
series and harder lectures occur later.

We assume that readers have covered the easier parts of the QuantEcon lecture
series [on Python
programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html).  

In
particular, readers should be familiar with basic Python syntax including
Python functions. Knowledge of classes and Matplotlib will be beneficial but
not essential.  

## Credits

In building this lecture series, we had invaluable assistance from research
assistants at QuantEcon, as well as our QuantEcon colleagues.  Without their
help this series would not have been possible.
