# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

```

## Overview

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are a somewhat advanced topic in linear and
matrix algebra.

At the same time, these concepts are extremely useful for 

* economic modeling (especially dynamics!)
* statistics
* some parts of applied mathematics
* machine learning
* and many other fields of science.

In this lecture we explain the basics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and
state two very important results from linear algebra.

The first is called the Neumann series theorem and the second is called the
Perron-Frobenius theorem.

We will explain what these theorems tell us and how we can use them to
understand the predictions of economic models.

We assume in this lecture that students are familiar with matrices and
understand the basics of matrix algebra.

We will use the following imports:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

## Matrices as Transformations

Let's start by discussing an important concept concerning matrices.

### Mapping Vectors into Vectors

One way to think about a given matrix is as a rectangular collection of
numbers.

Another way to think about a matrix is as a **map** (i.e., as a function) that
transforms vectors into new vectors.

To understand the second point of view, suppose we multiply an $n \times m$
matrix $A$ with an $m \times 1$ column vector $x$ to obtain an $n \times 1$
column vector $y$:

$$
    Ax = y
$$

If we fix $A$ and consider different choices of $x$, we can understand $A$ as
a map transforming $x$ into $Ax$.

Because $A$ is $n \times m$, it transforms $m$-vectors into $n$-vectors.

We can write this formally as $A \colon \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ 

(You might argue that if $A$ is a function then we should write 
$A(x) = y$ rather than $Ax = y$ but the second notation is more conventional.)

### Square Matrices

Let's restrict our discussion to square matrices.

In the above discussion, this means that $m=n$ and $A$ maps $\mathbb R^n$ into
itself.

To repeat, $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix that maps (or "transforms") a vector
$x$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ into a new vector $y=Ax$ also in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Here's one example:

$$
    \begin{bmatrix}
        2 & 1 \\
        -1 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\
        3
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        5 \\
        2
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

Here, the matrix

$$
    A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 
                        -1 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix}
$$

transforms the vector $x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$ into the vector
$y = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$.

Let's visualize this using Python:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: []

A = np.array([[2,  1], 
              [-1, 1]])
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: []

from math import sqrt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
# Set the axes through the origin

for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
    ax.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
for spine in ['right', 'top']:
    ax.spines[spine].set_color('none')

ax.set(xlim=(-2, 6), ylim=(-2, 4), aspect=1)

vecs = ((1, 3),(5, 2))
c = ['r','black']
for i, v in enumerate(vecs):
    ax.annotate('', xy=v, xytext=(0, 0),
                arrowprops=dict(color=c[i],
                shrink=0,
                alpha=0.7,
                width=0.5))
    
ax.text(0.2 + 1 , 0.2 + 3, 'x=$(1,3)$')
ax.text(0.2 + 5 , 0.2 + 2, 'Ax=$(5,2)$')
    
ax.annotate('', xy=(sqrt(10/29)* 5, sqrt(10/29) *2), xytext=(0, 0),
                arrowprops=dict(color='purple',
                shrink=0,
                alpha=0.7,
                width=0.5))

ax.annotate('',xy=(1,2/5),xytext=(1/3, 1),
             arrowprops={'arrowstyle':'->', 'connectionstyle':'arc3,rad=-0.3'}
             ,horizontalalignment='center')
ax.text(0.8,0.8, f'θ',fontsize =14)

plt.show()
```

One way to understand this transformation is that $A$ 

* first rotates $x$ by some angle $\theta$ 
* and then scales it by some scalar $\gamma$ to obtain the image $y$ of $x$.



## Types of Transformations

Let's examine some standard transformations we can perform with matrices.

Below we visualise transformations by thinking of vectors as points
instead of arrows.

We consider how a given matrix transforms 

* a grid of points and 
* a set of points located on the unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$

To build the transformations we will use two functions, called `grid_transform` and `circle_transform`.

Each of these functions visualizes the action of a given $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

def colorizer(x, y):
    r = min(1, 1-y/3)
    g = min(1, 1+y/3)
    b = 1/4 + x/16
    return (r, g, b)

def grid_transform(A = np.array([[1, -1], [1, 1]])):
    xvals = np.linspace(-4, 4, 9)
    yvals = np.linspace(-3, 3, 7)
    xygrid = np.column_stack([[x, y] for x in xvals for y in yvals])
    uvgrid = A @ xygrid
    
    colors = list(map(colorizer, xygrid[0], xygrid[1]))
    
    figure, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize = (10,5))
    
    for axes in ax:
        axes.set(xlim=(-11, 11), ylim=(-11, 11))
        axes.set_xticks([])
        axes.set_yticks([])
        for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
            axes.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
        for spine in ['right', 'top']:
            axes.spines[spine].set_color('none')
    
    # Plot x-y grid points
    ax[0].scatter(xygrid[0], xygrid[1], s=36, c=colors, edgecolor="none")
    #ax[0].grid(True)
    #ax[0].axis("equal")
    ax[0].set_title("points $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k$")
    
    # Plot transformed grid points
    ax[1].scatter(uvgrid[0], uvgrid[1], s=36, c=colors, edgecolor="none")
    #ax[1].grid(True)
    #ax[1].axis("equal")
    ax[1].set_title("points $Ax_1, Ax_2, \cdots, Ax_k$")
    
    plt.show()

def circle_transform(A = np.array([[-1, 2], [0, 1]])):
    
    figure, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize = (10,5))
    
    for axes in ax:
        axes.set(xlim=(-4, 4), ylim=(-4, 4))
        axes.set_xticks([])
        axes.set_yticks([])
        for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
            axes.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
        for spine in ['right', 'top']:
            axes.spines[spine].set_color('none')
    
    θ = np.linspace( 0 , 2 * np.pi , 150) 
    r = 1
    
    θ_1 = np.empty(12)
    for i in range(12):
        θ_1[i] = 2 * np.pi * (i/12)
    
    x = r * np.cos(θ) 
    y = r * np.sin(θ)
    a = r * np.cos(θ_1)
    b = r * np.sin(θ_1)
    a_1 = a.reshape(1,-1)
    b_1 = b.reshape(1,-1)
    colors = list(map(colorizer, a, b))
    ax[0].plot(x, y, color = 'black', zorder=1)
    ax[0].scatter(a_1,b_1, c = colors, alpha = 1, s = 60, edgecolors = 'black', zorder =2)
    ax[0].set_title("unit circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$")
    
    x1= x.reshape(1,-1)
    y1 = y.reshape(1, -1)
    ab = np.concatenate((a_1,b_1), axis=0)
    transformed_ab = A @ ab
    transformed_circle_input = np.concatenate((x1,y1), axis=0)
    transformed_circle = A @ transformed_circle_input
    ax[1].plot(transformed_circle[0,:], transformed_circle[1,:], color = 'black', zorder= 1) 
    ax[1].scatter(transformed_ab[0,:],transformed_ab[1:,], color = colors, alpha = 1, s = 60, edgecolors = 'black', zorder =2)
    ax[1].set_title("transformed circle")
   
    plt.show()
```

### Scaling

A matrix of the form 

$$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        \alpha & 0 
        \\ 0 & \beta 
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

scales vectors across the x-axis by a factor $\alpha$ and along the y-axis by
a factor $\beta$.

Here we illustrate a simple example where $\alpha = \beta = 3$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: []

A = np.array([[3 ,0],    #scaling by 3 in both directions
              [0, 3]])
grid_transform(A)
circle_transform(A)
```

### Shearing

A "shear" matrix of the form 

$$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        1 & \lambda \\ 
        0 & 1 
    \end{bmatrix}
$$ 

stretches vectors along the x-axis by an amount proportional to the
y-coordinate of a point.

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.array([[1, 2],     # shear along x-axis
              [0, 1]])
grid_transform(A)
circle_transform(A)
```

### Rotation

A matrix of the form 

$$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        \cos \theta & \sin \theta 
        \\ - \sin \theta & \cos \theta 
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
is called a _rotation matrix_.

This matrix rotates vectors clockwise by an angle $\theta$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
θ = np.pi/4      #45 degree clockwise rotation
A = np.array([[np.cos(θ), np.sin(θ)],
              [-np.sin(θ), np.cos(θ)]])
grid_transform(A)
```

### Permutation

The permutation matrix 

$$
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        0 & 1 \\ 
        1 & 0 
    \end{bmatrix}
$$ 
interchanges the coordinates of a vector.

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.column_stack([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
grid_transform(A)
```

More examples of common transition matrices can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix#Examples_in_2_dimensions).

## Matrix Multiplication as Composition

Since matrices act as functions that transform one vector to another, we can
apply the concept of function composition to matrices as well. 


### Linear Compositions

Consider the two matrices 

$$
    A = 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
            0 & 1 \\ 
            -1 & 0 
        \end{bmatrix}
        \quad \text{and} \quad
    B = 
        \begin{bmatrix} 
            1 & 2 \\ 
            0 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix}
$$ 

What will the output be when we try to obtain $ABx$ for some $2 \times 1$
vector $x$?

$$
\color{red}{\underbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
 -1 & 0
 \end{bmatrix}}
}_{\textstyle A} }
\color{red}{\underbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  0 & 1
 \end{bmatrix}}
}_{\textstyle B}}
\color{red}{\overbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  3
 \end{bmatrix}}
}^{\textstyle x}}
\rightarrow
\color{red}{\underbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  -1 & -2
 \end{bmatrix}}
}_{\textstyle AB}}
\color{red}{\overbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  3
 \end{bmatrix}}
}^{\textstyle x}}
\rightarrow
\color{red}{\overbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  3 \\
  -7
 \end{bmatrix}}
}^{\textstyle y}}
$$

$$
\color{red}{\underbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
 -1 & 0
 \end{bmatrix}}
}_{\textstyle A} }
\color{red}{\underbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 \\
  0 & 1
 \end{bmatrix}}
}_{\textstyle B}}
\color{red}{\overbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  3
 \end{bmatrix}}
}^{\textstyle x}}
\rightarrow
\color{red}{\underbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  -1 & 0
 \end{bmatrix}}
}_{\textstyle A}}
\color{red}{\overbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  7 \\
  3
 \end{bmatrix}}
}^{\textstyle Bx}}
\rightarrow
\color{red}{\overbrace{
 \color{black}{\begin{bmatrix}
  3 \\
  -7
 \end{bmatrix}}
}^{\textstyle y}}
$$

We can observe that applying the transformation $AB$ on the vector $x$ is the
same as first applying $B$ on $x$ and then applying $A$ on the vector $Bx$.

Thus the matrix product $AB$ is the
[composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition) of the
matrix transformations $A$ and $B$.

(To compose the transformations, first apply transformation $B$ and then
transformation $A$.)

When we matrix multiply an $n \times m$ matrix $A$ with an $m \times k$ matrix
$B$ the obtained matrix product is an $n \times k$ matrix $AB$.

Thus, if $A$ and $B$ are transformations such that $A \colon \mathbb{R}^m \to
\mathbb{R}^n$ and $B \colon \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^m$, then $AB$
transforms $\mathbb{R}^k$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Viewing matrix multiplication as composition of maps helps us
understand why, under matrix multiplication, $AB$ is not generally equal to $BA$.

(After all, when we compose functions, the order usually matters.)

### Examples

Let $A$ be the $90^{\circ}$ clockwise rotation matrix given by
$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and let $B$ be a shear matrix
along the x-axis given by $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

We will visualise how a grid of points changes when we apply the
transformation $AB$ and then compare it with the transformation $BA$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

def grid_composition_transform(A = np.array([[1, -1], [1, 1]]), B = np.array([[1, -1], [1, 1]])):
    xvals = np.linspace(-4, 4, 9)
    yvals = np.linspace(-3, 3, 7)
    xygrid = np.column_stack([[x, y] for x in xvals for y in yvals])
    uvgrid = B @ xygrid
    abgrid = A @ uvgrid
    
    colors = list(map(colorizer, xygrid[0], xygrid[1]))
    
    figure, ax = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize = (15,5))
    
    for axes in ax:
        axes.set(xlim=(-12, 12), ylim=(-12, 12))
        axes.set_xticks([])
        axes.set_yticks([])
        for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
            axes.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
        for spine in ['right', 'top']:
            axes.spines[spine].set_color('none')
            
    # Plot grid points
    ax[0].scatter(xygrid[0], xygrid[1], s=36, c=colors, edgecolor="none")
    ax[0].set_title("points $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k$")
    
    # Plot intermediate grid points
    ax[1].scatter(uvgrid[0], uvgrid[1], s=36, c=colors, edgecolor="none")
    ax[1].set_title("points $Bx_1, Bx_2, \cdots, Bx_k$")
    
    #Plot transformed grid points
    ax[2].scatter(abgrid[0], abgrid[1], s=36, c=colors, edgecolor="none")
    ax[2].set_title("points $ABx_1, ABx_2, \cdots, ABx_k$")

    plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
θ = np.pi/2 
#B = np.array([[np.cos(θ), np.sin(θ)],
#              [-np.sin(θ), np.cos(θ)]])
A = np.array([[0, 1],     # 90 degree clockwise rotation
              [-1, 0]])
B = np.array([[1, 2],     # shear along x-axis
              [0, 1]])
```

#### Shear then Rotate

```{code-cell} ipython3
grid_composition_transform(A,B)        #transformation AB
```

#### Rotate then Shear

```{code-cell} ipython3
grid_composition_transform(B,A)         #transformation BA
```

It is quite evident that the transformation $AB$ is not the same as the transformation $BA$.

## Iterating on a Fixed Map

In economics (and especially in dynamic modeling), we often are interested in
analyzing behavior where we repeatedly apply a fixed matrix.

For example, given a vector $v$ and a matrix $A$, we are interested in
studying the sequence

$$ 
    v, \quad
    Av, \quad
    AAv = A^2v, \ldots
$$

Let's first see examples of a sequence of iterates $(A^k v)_{k \geq 0}$ under
different maps $A$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from numpy.linalg import matrix_power
from matplotlib import cm

def plot_series(B, v, n):
    
    A = np.array([[1, -1],
                  [1, 0]])
    
    figure, ax = plt.subplots()
    
    ax.set(xlim=(-4, 4), ylim=(-4, 4))
    ax.set_xticks([])
    ax.set_yticks([])
    for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_position('zero')
    for spine in ['right', 'top']:
        ax.spines[spine].set_color('none')
        
    θ = np.linspace( 0 , 2 * np.pi , 150) 
    r = 2.5
    x = r * np.cos(θ) 
    y = r * np.sin(θ)
    x1 = x.reshape(1,-1)
    y1 = y.reshape(1, -1)
    xy = np.concatenate((x1,y1), axis=0)
    
    ellipse = A @ xy
    ax.plot(ellipse[0,:], ellipse[1,:], color = 'black', linestyle = (0, (5,10)), linewidth = 0.5)
    
    colors = plt.cm.rainbow(np.linspace(0,1,20))# Initialize holder for trajectories
    
    for i in range(n):
        iteration = matrix_power(B, i) @ v
        v1 = iteration[0]
        v2 = iteration[1]
        ax.scatter(v1, v2, color=colors[i])
        if i == 0:
            ax.text(v1+0.25, v2, f'$v$')
        if i == 1:
            ax.text(v1+0.25, v2, f'$Av$')
        if 1< i < 4:
            ax.text(v1+0.25, v2, f'$A^{i}v$')
            
    plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
B = np.array([[sqrt(3) + 1, -2],
              [1, sqrt(3) - 1]])
B = (1/(2*sqrt(2))) * B
v = (-3,-3)
n = 12

plot_series(B, v, n)
```

Here with each iteration the vectors get shorter, i.e., move closer to the origin.

In this case, repeatedly multiplying a vector by $A$ makes the vector "spiral in".

```{code-cell} ipython3
B = np.array([[sqrt(3) + 1, -2],
              [1, sqrt(3) - 1]])
B = (1/2) * B
v = (2.5,0)
n = 12

plot_series(B, v, n)
```

Here with each iteration vectors do not tend to get longer or shorter. 

In this case, repeatedly multiplying a vector by $A$ simply "rotates it around
an ellipse".

```{code-cell} ipython3
B = np.array([[sqrt(3) + 1, -2],
              [1, sqrt(3) - 1]])
B = (1/sqrt(2)) * B
v = (-1,-0.25)
n = 6

plot_series(B, v, n)
```

Here with each iteration vectors tend to get longer, i.e., farther from the
origin. 

In this case, repeatedly multiplying a vector by $A$ makes the vector "spiral out".

We thus observe that the sequence $(A^kv)_{k \geq 0}$ behaves differently depending on the map $A$ itself.

We now discuss the property of A that determines this behaviour.

(la_eigenvalues)=
## Eigenvalues 

```{index} single: Linear Algebra; Eigenvalues
```

In this section we introduce the notions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### Definitions

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ square matrix.

If $\lambda$ is scalar and $v$ is a non-zero $n$-vector  such that

$$
A v = \lambda v
$$

then we say that $\lambda$ is an *eigenvalue* of $A$, and $v$ is an *eigenvector*.

Thus, an eigenvector of $A$ is a nonzero vector $v$ such that when the map $A$ is
applied, $v$ is merely scaled.

The next figure shows two eigenvectors (blue arrows) and their images under
$A$ (red arrows).

As expected, the image $Av$ of each $v$ is just a scaled version of the original

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [output_scroll]

from numpy.linalg import eig

A = ((1, 2),
     (2, 1))
A = np.array(A)
evals, evecs = eig(A)
evecs = evecs[:, 0], evecs[:, 1]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))
# Set the axes through the origin
for spine in ['left', 'bottom']:
    ax.spines[spine].set_position('zero')

### Complex Values

So far our definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors seems straightforward.

There is, however, one complication we haven't mentioned yet:

When solving $Av = \lambda v$, 

* $\lambda$ is allowed to be a complex number and
* $v$ is allowed to be an $n$-vector of complex numbers.

We will see some examples below.


### Some Mathematical Details

We note some mathematical details for more advanced readers.

(Other readers can skip to the next section.)

The eigenvalue equation is equivalent to $(A - \lambda I) v = 0$. 

This equation has a nonzero solution $v$ only when the columns of $A - \lambda I$ are linearly dependent.

This in turn is equivalent to stating that the determinant is zero.

Hence, to find all eigenvalues, we can look for $\lambda$ such that the
determinant of $A - \lambda I$ is zero.

This problem can be expressed as one of solving for the roots of a polynomial
in $\lambda$ of degree $n$.

This in turn implies the existence of $n$ solutions in the complex
plane, although some might be repeated.



### Facts 

Some nice facts about the eigenvalues of a square matrix $A$ are as follows:

1. The determinant of $A$ equals  the product of the eigenvalues.
1. The trace of $A$ (the sum of the elements on the principal diagonal) equals the sum of the eigenvalues.
1. If $A$ is symmetric, then all of its eigenvalues are real.
1. If $A$ is invertible and $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ are its eigenvalues, then the eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are $1/\lambda_1, \ldots, 1/\lambda_n$.

A corollary of the first statement is that a matrix is invertible if and only if all its eigenvalues are nonzero.

### Computation

Using NumPy, we can solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix as follows

```{code-cell} ipython3
from numpy.linalg import eig

A = ((1, 2),
     (2, 1))

A = np.array(A)
evals, evecs = eig(A)
evals   #eigenvalues
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
evecs   #eigenvectors
```

Note that the *columns* of `evecs` are the eigenvectors.

Since any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is an eigenvector with the same
eigenvalue (check it), the eig routine normalizes the length of each eigenvector
to one.

The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a map $A$ determine how a vector $v$ is transformed when we repeatedly multiply by $A$.

This is discussed further below.



## Nonnegative Matrices 

Often, in economics, the matrix that we are dealing with is nonnegative.

Nonnegative matrices have several special and useful properties.

In this section we discuss some of them --- in particular, the connection
between nonnegativity and eigenvalues.


### Nonnegative Matrices

An $n \times m$ matrix $A$ is called **nonnegative** if every element of $A$
is nonnegative, i.e., $a_{ij} \geq 0$ for every $i,j$.

We denote this as $A \geq 0$.


### Irreducible Matrices

Let $A$ be a square nonnegative matrix and let $A^k$ be the $k^{th}$ power of A.

Let $a^{k}_{ij}$ be element $(i,j)$ of $A^k$.

$A$ is called **irreducible** if for each $(i,j)$ there is an integer $k \geq 0$ such that $a^{k}_{ij} > 0$.

A matrix $A$ that is not irreducible is called reducible.

Here are some examples to illustrate this further.

1. $A = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0.1 \\ 0.2 & 0.2 \end{bmatrix}$ is irreducible since $a_{ij}>0$ for all $(i,j)$.

2. $A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ is irreducible since $a_{12},a_{21} >0$ and $a^{2}_{11},a^{2}_{22} >0$.

3. $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ is reducible since $A^k = A$ for all $k \geq 0$ and thus
   $a^{k}_{12},a^{k}_{21} = 0$ for all $k \geq 0$.


### The Perron-Frobenius Theorem

For a nonnegative matrix $A$ the behaviour of $A^k$ as $k \to \infty$ is controlled by the eigenvalue with the largest
absolute value, often called the **dominant eigenvalue**.

For a matrix $A$, the Perron-Frobenius theorem characterises certain
properties of the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector when
$A$ is a nonnegative square matrix.

```{prf:theorem} Perron-Frobenius Theorem
:label: perron-frobenius

If a matrix $A \geq 0$ then,

1. the dominant eigenvalue of $A$, $r(A)$, is real-valued and nonnegative. 
2. for any other eigenvalue (possibly complex) $\lambda$ of $A$, $|\lambda| \leq r(A)$.
3. we can find a nonnegative and nonzero eigenvector $v$ such that $Av = r(A)v$.

Moreover if $A$ is also irreducible then,

4. the eigenvector $v$ associated with the eigenvalue $r(A)$ is strictly positive.
5. there exists no other positive eigenvector $v$ (except scalar multiples of v) associated with $r(A)$.

```

(This is a relatively simple version of the theorem --- for more details see
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron%E2%80%93Frobenius_theorem)).

We will see applications of the theorem below.


(la_neumann)=
## The Neumann Series Lemma 

```{index} single: Neumann's Lemma
```

In this section we present a famous result about series of matrices that has
many applications in economics.

### Scalar Series

Here's a fundamental result about series that you surely know:

If $a$ is a number and $|a| < 1$, then 

```{math}
:label: gp_sum
    
    \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a^k =\frac{1}{1-a} = (1 - a)^{-1} 

```

For a one-dimensional linear equation $x = ax + b$ where x is unknown we can thus conclude that the solution $x^{*}$ is given by:

$$
    x^{*} = \frac{b}{1-a} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a^k b
$$

### Matrix Series

A generalization of this idea exists in the matrix setting.

Consider the system of equations $x = Ax + b$ where $A$ is an $n \times n$
square matrix and $x$ and $b$ are both column vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Using matrix algebra we can conclude that the solution to this system of equations will be given by:

```{math}
:label: neumann_eqn
    
    x^{*} = (I-A)^{-1}b

```

What guarantees the existence of a unique vector $x^{*}$ that satisfies
{eq}`neumann_eqn` ?

The following is a fundamental result in functional analysis that generalises
{eq}`gp_sum` to a multivariate case.


```{prf:theorem} Neumann Series Lemma
:label: neumann_series_lemma

Let $A$ be a square matrix and let $A^k$ be the $k$-th power of $A$.

Let $r(A)$ be the dominant eigenvector or as it is commonly called the *spectral radius*, defined as $\max_i |\lambda_i|$, where 

* $\{\lambda_i\}_i$ is the set of eigenvalues of $A$ and
* $|\lambda_i|$ is the modulus of the complex number $\lambda_i$

Neumann's theorem states the following: If $r(A) < 1$, then $I - A$ is invertible, and

$$
(I - A)^{-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} A^k
$$
```

We can see the Neumann series lemma in action in the following example.

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.array([[0.4, 0.1],
              [0.7, 0.2]])

evals, evecs = eig(A)   # finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors

r = max(abs(λ) for λ in evals)    # compute spectral radius
print(r)
```

The spectral radius $r(A)$ obtained is less than 1. 

Thus, we can apply the Neumann Series lemma to find $(I-A)^{-1}$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
I = np.identity(2)      #2 x 2 identity matrix
B = I-A
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
B_inverse = np.linalg.inv(B)     #direct inverse method
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
A_sum = np.zeros((2,2))        #power series sum of A
A_power = I
for i in range(50):
    A_sum += A_power
    A_power = A_power @ A
```

Let's check equality between the sum and the inverse methods.

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.allclose(A_sum, B_inverse)     
```

Although we truncate the infinite sum at $k = 50$, both methods give us the same
result which illustrates the result of the Neumann Series lemma.

## Exercises

```{exercise-start} Leontief's Input-Output Model
:label: eig_ex1
```
[Wassily Leontief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Leontief) developed a model of an economy with $n$ sectors producing $n$ different commodities representing the interdependencies of different sectors of an economy.

Under this model some of the output is consumed internally by the industries and the rest is consumed by external consumers.

We define a simple model with 3 sectors - agriculture, industry, and service.

The following table describes how output is distributed within the economy:

|             | Total output | Agriculture | Industry | Service | Consumer |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Agriculture |     $x_1$    |   0.3$x_1$  | 0.2$x_2$ |0.3$x_3$ |     4    |
|   Industry  |     $x_2$    |   0.2$x_1$  | 0.4$x_2$ |0.3$x_3$ |     5    |
|   Service   |     $x_3$    |   0.2$x_1$  | 0.5$x_2$ |0.1$x_3$ |    12    |

The first row depicts how agriculture's total output $x_1$ is distributed 

* $0.3x_1$ is used as inputs within agriculture itself,
* $0.2x_2$ is used as inputs by the industry sector to produce $x_2$ units
* $0.3x_3$ is used as inputs by the service sector to produce $x_3$ units and 
* 4 units is the external demand by consumers.

We can transform this into a system of linear equations for the 3 sectors as
given below:

$$
    x_1 = 0.3x_1 + 0.2x_2 + 0.3x_3 + 4 \\
    x_2 = 0.2x_1 + 0.4x_2 + 0.3x_3 + 5 \\
    x_3 = 0.2x_1 + 0.5x_2 + 0.1x_3 + 12
$$

This can be transformed into the matrix equation $x = Ax + d$ where

$$
x =
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    x_2 \\
    x_3
\end{bmatrix}
, \; A =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0.3 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\
    0.2 & 0.4 & 0.3 \\
    0.2 & 0.5 & 0.1
\end{bmatrix}
\; \text{and} \;
d =
\begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    5 \\
    12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The solution $x^{*}$ is given by the equation $x^{*} = (I-A)^{-1} d$

1. Since $A$ is a nonnegative irreducible matrix, find the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of $A$.

2. Use the Neumann Series lemma to find the solution $x^{*}$ if it exists.

```{exercise-end}
```

```{solution-start} eig_ex1
:class: dropdown
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
A = np.array([[0.3, 0.2, 0.3],
              [0.2, 0.4, 0.3],
              [0.2, 0.5, 0.1]])

evals, evecs = eig(A)

r = max(abs(λ) for λ in evals)   #dominant eigenvalue/spectral radius
print(r)
```

Since we have $r(A) < 1$ we can thus find the solution using the Neumann Series lemma.

```{code-cell} ipython3
I = np.identity(3)
B = I - A

d = np.array([4, 5, 12])
d.shape = (3,1)

B_inv = np.linalg.inv(B)
x_star = B_inv @ d
print(x_star)
```
