    "# Laffer Curves  with Adaptive Expectations \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture studies stationary and dynamic **Laffer curves** in the inflation tax rate in a non-linear version of the model studied in this  lecture {doc}`money_inflation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the lecture {doc}`money_inflation`, this lecture uses the log-linear version of the demand function for money that  {cite}`Cagan` used in his classic paper in place of the linear demand function used in this  lecture {doc}`money_inflation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now, instead of assuming  ''rational expectations'' in the form of ''perfect foresight'',\n",
    "we'll adopt the ''adaptive expectations'' assumption used by  {cite}`Cagan` and {cite}`Friedman1956`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that instead of assuming that expected inflation $\\pi_t^*$ is described by the \"perfect foresight\" or \"rational expectations\" hypothesis \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi_t^* = p_{t+1} - p_t\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "that we adopted in lectures {doc}`money_inflation` and lectures {doc}`money_inflation_nonlinear`, we'll now assume that $\\pi_t^*$ is determined by the adaptive expectations hypothesis described in equation {eq}`eq:adaptex`  reported below. \n",
    "\n",
    "We shall discover that changing our hypothesis about expectations formation in this way will change some our findings and leave others intact.  In particular, we shall discover that\n",
    "\n",
    "* replacing rational expectations with adaptive expectations leaves the two stationary inflation rates unchanged, but that $\\ldots$ \n",
    "* it reverses the perverse dynamics by making the **lower** stationary inflation rate the one to which the system typically converges\n",
    "* a more plausible comparative dynamic outcome emerges in which now inflation can be **reduced** by running **lower**  government deficits\n",
    "\n",
    "These more plausible comparative dynamics underlie the \"old time religion\" that states that \n",
    "\"inflation is always and everywhere caused by government deficits\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues were studied by {cite}`bruno1990seigniorage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their purpose was to reverse  what they thought were counter intuitive\n",
    "predictions of their model under rational expectations (i.e., perfect foresight in this context)\n",
    "by dropping rational expectations and instead assuming that people form  expectations about future inflation rates according to the \"adaptive expectations\"  scheme {eq}`eq:adaptex` described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "{cite}`sargent1989least`  had studied another way of selecting stationary equilibrium that involved replacing rational expectations with a model of  learning via least squares regression.  \n",
