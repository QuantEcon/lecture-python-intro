    "## An Introduction to Graph Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've looked at some examples, let's move on to theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theory will allow us to better organize our thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical part of network science is constructed using a major branch of\n",
    "mathematics called [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph theory can be complicated and we will cover only the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these concepts will already be enough for us to discuss interesting and\n",
    "important ideas on economic and financial networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on \"directed\" graphs, where connections are, in general, asymmetric\n",
    "(arrows typically point one way, not both ways).\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "* bank $A$ lends money to bank $B$\n",
    "* firm $A$ supplies goods to firm $B$\n",
    "* individual $A$ \"follows\" individual $B$ on a given social network\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"Undirected\" graphs, where connections are symmetric, are a special\n",
    "case of directed graphs --- we just need to insist that each arrow pointing\n",
    "from $A$ to $B$ is paired with another arrow pointing from $B$ to $A$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **directed graph** consists of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a finite set $V$ and\n",
    "1. a collection of pairs $(u, v)$ where $u$ and $v$ are elements of $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of $V$ are called the **vertices** or **nodes** of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pairs $(u,v)$ are called the **edges** of the graph and the set of all edges will usually be denoted by $E$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively and visually, an edge $(u,v)$ is understood as an arrow from node $u$ to node $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(A neat way to represent an arrow is to record the location of the tail and\n",
    "head of the arrow, and that's exactly what an edge does.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the aircraft export example shown in {numref}`aircraft_network`\n",
    "\n",
    "* $V$ is all countries included in the data set.\n",
    "* $E$ is all the arrows in the figure, each indicating some positive amount of aircraft exports from one country to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at more examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two graphs are shown below, each with three nodes."

    "Some pages have high **hub centrality**, meaning that they link to valuable\n",
    "sources of information (e.g., news aggregation sites).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other pages have high **authority centrality**, meaning that they contain\n",
    "valuable information, as indicated by the number and significance of incoming\n",
    "links (e.g., websites of respected news organizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar ideas can and have been applied to economic networks (often using\n",
